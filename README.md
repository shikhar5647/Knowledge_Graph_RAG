# Knowledge Graphs for RAG

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository explores the integration of **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** into **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines to enhance information retrieval and structured reasoning. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs, we aim to improve response accuracy, contextual understanding, and information grounding in generative AI models.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Graph-based Retrieval:** Uses Knowledge Graphs to structure and retrieve information efficiently.
- **Entity Linking & Reasoning:** Enhances contextual understanding by linking extracted entities.
